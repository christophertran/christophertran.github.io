        <h4>Why am I in this class?</h4>
        <p>I am in this class because I think data visualization would be a useful skill. This is because data is
          becoming more and more readily available and the ability to turn that data into useful information/knowledge
          is an invaluable skill.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.tableau.com/covid-19-coronavirus-data-resources" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Useful visualization</a></h4>
        <p>This is a really useful data visualization showing by Tableau, this is really useful because it shows many
          dimension of the covid-19 data that has been collected. From this you are able to see the differences between
          all the US states and difference between all countries. You are able to see the cases, deaths, vaccine rollout
          numbers, etc.</p>

        <h4><a
            href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/512b3ac1e4b01fa6748fff20/1472696019873-ZZNQRV87H9BKB1XV02PC/NBC+Zika+Virus+Chart+Fail?format=750w"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-useful
            visualization</a></h4>
        <p>The data visualization linked is not very useful. That main reason is because it had been made to be
          intentionally misleading. One of the way it's intentionally misleading is that despite the numbers above the
          bar charts, 34%, 28%, 25%, 13%. The bar for 13 is over 4 times larger than the bar chart of 34%, this is
          extremely misleading and encourages a misunderstanding of the data when looked at with a quick glance</p>
